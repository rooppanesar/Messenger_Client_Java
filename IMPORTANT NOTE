To run the messenger application, first download this project and then go to my another repository which is named as "Messenger_Server". Download both repositories and open it in two different IntelliJ windows. First RUN the Server side application, and then RUN this project. Two windows will pop up and you can start chatting with your friend.

Hope it will work./
